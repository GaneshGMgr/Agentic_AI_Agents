Okay, so I need to help plan a 2-day trip to Bali. Let me start by recalling what I know about Bali's main attractions. I think the iconic spots are Tirta Gangga Palace and Jimbaran Bay. Oh right, Uluwatu is also a must-visit for the cliffs and sunset views.

For the hotels, I remember places like The Legian and the Ritz-Carlton are popular. They're probably good options with great amenities. I should check their prices online to make sure they fit within my budget.

Local restaurants... I've heard of Nusantara and Ondine being recommended spots. These places might have a mix of local and international dishes, which sounds appealing for trying new things.

Transportation in Bali is mostly by tuk-tuks or private taxis, right? Those are convenient but can be expensive if driven around a lot. Maybe I should plan to take them to the main attractions each day instead of using buses or rice trucks too often.

Weather-wise, Bali typically has a nice monsoon climate with warm days and cooler nights. So for two days, it should be comfortable, maybe in the early morning to avoid the heat.

Exenses... Let me think: accommodation is around $150-200 per night when booked in advance. Breakfasts at restaurants might be between $8-12 each, lunch around $15-20, and dinner similar. Taxis are pricey, maybe $4-6 one way, but I can walk a bit if the distance isn't too far.

For the first day, starting with the palace in the morning makes sense, then exploring the rice terraces nearby. Lunch at Nusantara sounds good. After that, visiting Jimbaran Bay for some boat rides and maybe some local markets before heading to Uluwatu for cliff walks and sunset views.

Dinner at Ondine could be a nice way to relax with a nice view of the ocean. 

The second day should start early again to catch the train to Echo Beach in the morning. Explore the nearby villages, maybe do some shopping or have lunch there before taking a boat ride back or going on a day trip.

I need to make sure transportation between these points is considered. The tuk-tuks would be cheaper than taxis but might not be available everywhere. Also, booking them in advance could help with timing and cost.

Let me also check if there are any local activities that are free or have discounts since two days is a short time. Maybe some cultural tours or art galleries nearby.

Overall, the itinerary needs to balance between well-known attractions and some hidden gems to make it off-the-beaten-path but still enjoyable.
