# üß†‚úàÔ∏è DEEP WEB RESEARCH AGENTIC AI SYSTEM

This is a simple practice project I built to explore how AI agents can search for information from various sources ‚Äî especially beyond just Google.  
It uses tools like **Tavily** and **DuckDuckGo** to fetch real-time data and academic content, simulating what an "agentic AI" might do when trying to research something on its own.

The project runs completely **locally** using an **Ollama-hosted LLM model** ‚Äî so we don‚Äôt need to rely on cloud APIs like OpenAI or Anthropic to try it out. That makes it easier, private, and great for learning how to build LLM-powered tools with minimal external dependencies.

The main goal here is to experiment with how a system can:
- Search the web
- Query scholarly APIs
- Understand questions better using local AI models
- And manage responses in a structured way (with caching and multi-source support)

It‚Äôs not meant to be production-ready ‚Äî just a solid learning experiment.

## üöÄ Running the Agentic Research Server

Start the Ollama server and then the FastAPI backend:

```bash
# Start Ollama (model hosting for LLMs)
ollama serve

# Start the FastAPI server
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# (Optional) Use hot reload for development
uvicorn app:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## üí° What Does "Deep Web Research Agentic AI System" Actually Mean?

- **Deep Web Research**: This just means searching places beyond typical Google results ‚Äî like academic papers, scientific APIs, or real-time info from other platforms.
- **Agentic AI**: A simple form of ‚ÄúAI that acts on its own.‚Äù Here, the system can decide where to look, what to search, and how to organize the results automatically.
- **Search Tools**: This project uses APIs like **Tavily** and **DuckDuckGo** to gather real-time search results ‚Äî combining web and academic content.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This is a personal practice project built with local models via Ollama. Some parts may still be experimental, but it's a great base for building more advanced tools.
