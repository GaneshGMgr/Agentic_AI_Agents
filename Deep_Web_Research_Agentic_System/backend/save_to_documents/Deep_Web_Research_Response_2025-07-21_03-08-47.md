# Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on global society, economy, and individual lives. Mental health has been particularly affected, with many people experiencing anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues due to the uncertainty, isolation, and stress caused by the pandemic. Understanding public sentiment and trends in mental health discussions is crucial for developing effective interventions and supporting vulnerable populations.

# Background and Literature Review

Research has shown that social media platforms can provide valuable insights into public opinion and behavior. Reddit, in particular, has been a useful platform for studying mental health discussions due to its anonymous nature and the diversity of topics covered by users. Previous studies have examined the relationship between social media posts and mental health outcomes, as well as the role of social media in shaping public attitudes towards mental health.

# Methodology

This study employed a longitudinal topical analysis approach, examining postings on four subreddits (r/depression, r/Anxiety, r/SuicideWatch, and r/Coronavirus) from January 2020 to October 2020. The data were analyzed using sentiment analysis techniques and topic modeling methods to identify trends and correlations between posts.

# Findings

Our results show a high topical correlation between postings in r/depression and r/Coronavirus in September 2020, indicating a significant increase in discussions about mental health issues during this time period. Additionally, the topical correlation between postings on substance use disorders and Coronavirus fluctuated over time, with the highest correlation observed in August 2020.

# Discussion and Implications

The findings from this study suggest that social media platforms can provide valuable insights into public sentiment and trends in mental health discussions. The results also highlight the importance of targeted interventions and public health strategies to address mental health issues exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

By monitoring these trends on platforms like Reddit, epidemiologists and mental health professionals can gain a better understanding of the challenges faced by communities and develop more effective solutions to support vulnerable populations.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, this study demonstrates the importance of using social media data for understanding public sentiment and trends in mental health discussions. The findings from this study highlight the need for targeted interventions and public health strategies to address mental health issues exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Future research should build on these findings to develop more effective solutions for supporting vulnerable populations.
